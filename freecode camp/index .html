        <ul>
          <li>
            Emory Andrew Tate III (born December 1, 1986) is a British-American
            social media personality, businessman, and former professional
            kickboxer.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tate began practicing kickboxing in 2005 and gained his first
            championship in 2009. He attracted wider attention in 2016, when he
            appeared on the British reality show Big Brother and was removed
            after his comments on social media attracted controversy. He began
            offering paid courses and memberships through his website and rose
            to fame as an internet celebrity, promoting an "ultra-masculine,
            ultra-luxurious lifestyle".
          </li>
          <li>
            Emory Andrew Tate III[8] was born on December 1, 1986,[9][10] in
            Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C.[11][12] He is
            mixed-race.[13] His African American father Emory Tate was a chess
            international master[14] and his mother worked as a catering
            assistant.[15] He has a brother, Tristan. He was raised in Chicago,
            Illinois and Goshen, Indiana. After his parents divorced, his mother
            brought both brothers to England.[16] Tate was raised in the
            Christian faith.[17] He learned to play chess at the age of five and
            competed in adult tournaments as a child.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tate's website offers training courses on accumulating wealth and
            "maleâ€“female interactions".[27] According to the website, he also
            operated a webcam studio using his girlfriends as employees.[27]
            Tate and his brother Tristan started the webcam business, employing
            as many as 75 webcam models[31] to sell "fake sob stories" to male
            callers,[32] claiming to have made millions of dollars doing so. He
            later said that the business model was a "total scam"
          </li>
          <li>
            In 2017, Tate moved from the United Kingdom to Romania. He said that
            he moved because he liked "living in countries where corruption is
            accessible for everybody"[59] and believed that it would be less
            likely to face rape charges in Romania, stating that Romanian police
            would ask women reporting rapes for "evidence" or "CCTV proof",
            whereas in the Western world, amid the MeToo movement,
          </li>
          <li>
            Tate said that any woman "at any point in the future can destroy
            your life."
